POPPI is short for Pop!_OS Post-Installation, which is basically a set of methods to download and install files, apply settings, and make other tweaks to the Pop!_OS operating system after installation as necessary.

The script was tested under Pop!_OS 22.04 only. So, please use and modify with care.
